# DataClasses
## Overview
In this project, we cover the usage of Data Classes for usage in large data structures. For example, if we want to load in data from a previously used relational database, we can create data classes that replicate the database's table structure. 

This is useful for when we want to add, remove, modify or compare data in our database through personalized code via class methods.
